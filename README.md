# Light-Intensity-Controller-for-Mushrooms--Logic-Circuit-Design
Logic Circuit Design report, the project is about Light Intensity Controller for Mushrooms. Where we collaaborated as a team to design a digital logic circuit to control light intensity for mushroom cultivation, simulated in Logisim and tested on a breadboard.
